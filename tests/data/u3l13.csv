Modularity - Sprites and Sprite Properties,(1) list the name of each sprite created. (2) list the sprite name and property name for every sprite property that is updated inside the draw loop (e.g. `mySprite.myProperty`). (3) List each sprite that does not have a property updated in the draw loop,"At least 2 sprites created, each with at least one property updating in the draw loop.","At least 1 sprite created with at least one property updated inside the draw loop","At least 1 sprite created. No properties updated inside the draw loop.","No sprites are used in the program."
Position and Movement,"(1) list the name of each sprite placed on the screen. (2) list each shape placed on the screen. (3) list each line of text placed on the screen (4) list the lines of code inside of the draw loop that update the position of sprites, shapes, or text on the screen. (5) list any sprites, shapes, or text that use random movement. (6) list any sprites, shapes, or text that use the counter pattern","At least 2 shapes, 2 sprites, and 2 lines of text are placed correctly on the screen using the coordinate system. At least 2 elements move in different ways.","At least 1 shape, 2 sprites, and 1 line of text are placed on the screen using the coordinate system. At least 1 element moves during the program.","A cumulative of at least a total of 3 elements are placed on the screen using the coordinate system (e.g 2 sprites & 1 line of text or 1 sprite, 1 shape, & 1 line of text).","No elements (sprites, shapes, or text) are placed on the screen using the coordinate system."
"Optional “Stretch” Feature - Variables","(1) list the name of each variable created and the value stored in that variable. (2) list each variable that is not used to store a sprite or a sprite property.",At least 2 non-sprite variables are created and their values are updated in the draw loop and affect the program output.,"At least 1 non-sprite variable is created and its value is updated in the draw loop and affects the program output.",At least 1 non-sprite variable is created and used in the program but does not update in the draw loop.,No non-sprite variables are created and used.
