Key Concept	Observations	Grade	Reason
Modularity - Sprites and Sprite Properties	(1) The sprites created are: backgroundSprite, snowman, santa. (2) The sprite properties updated inside the draw loop are: backgroundSprite.animation, santa.animation, santa.x, snowman.rotation. (3) All sprites have a property updated in the draw loop.	Extensive Evidence	At least 2 sprites are created, each with at least one property updating in the draw loop.
Position and Movement	(1) The sprites placed on the screen are: backgroundSprite, snowman, santa. (2) No shapes are placed on the screen. (3) No text is placed on the screen. (4) The lines of code inside of the draw loop that update the position of sprites are: santa.x = santa.x + randomNumber(-1, 1), snowman.rotation++. (5) The sprite that uses random movement is santa. (6) The sprite that uses the counter pattern is snowman.	Limited Evidence	2 sprites are placed on the screen using the coordinate system, but no shapes or lines of text are created. At least 1 element moves during the program.
Optional “Stretch” Feature - Variables	(1) The variables created are: backgroundSprite, snowman, santa. The values stored in these variables are sprites. (2) No variables are created that are not used to store a sprite or a sprite property.	No Evidence	No non-sprite variables are created.
