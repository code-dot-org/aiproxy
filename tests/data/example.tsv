Key Concept	Observations	Grade	Reason
Modularity - Sprites and Sprite Properties	(1) Sprites: alienBlue, alienGreen. (2) Sprite properties updated in draw loop: alienGreen.y, alienBlue.rotation. (3) All sprites have a property updated in the draw loop.	Extensive Evidence	There are two sprites created (alienBlue and alienGreen) and each has at least one property (alienGreen.y and alienBlue.rotation) updated inside the draw loop.
Position and Movement	(1) The sprites placed on the screen are: alienBlue at (100, 200), alienGreen at (250, 575). (2) The shapes placed on the screen are: ellipse at (375, -50), ellipse at (125, 75), ellipse at (350, 350). (3) The lines of text placed on the screen are: "What kind of music do planets sing?" at (textX, 125), "Neptunes!" at (200, textY). (4) Position updates in draw loop: textY = textY - 3, textX = 25 + randomNumber(-3, 3), alienGreen.y = alienGreen.y - 3, alienBlue.rotation = random( -5, 5). (5) Random movement: textX, alienBlue.rotation. (6) Counter pattern: textY, alienGreen.y.	Extensive Evidence	There are at least two shapes, two sprites, and two lines of text placed on the screen using the coordinate system. Two variables (textX and alienBlue.rotation) use random movement, and Two variables (textY and alienGreen.y) use the counter pattern.
Optional “Stretch” Feature - Variables	(1) Variables 'alienBlue', 'alienGreen', 'textY', and 'textX' are created and store sprites and numbers respectively. (2) 'textY' and 'textX' are non-sprite variables.	Extensive Evidence	At least two non-sprite variables (textY and textX) are created and their values are updated in the draw loop, affecting the program output.
