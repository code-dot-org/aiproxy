Program Development 2,(1) does the program effectively use whitespace? (2) does the program use good naming conventions? (3) does the program have good indentation? (4) does the program have good comments? (5) is the code easily readable?,"The program code effectively uses whitespace, good naming conventions, indentation and comments to make the code easily readable.","The program code makes use of whitespace, indentation, and comments.",The program code has few comments and does not consistently use formatting such as whitespace and indentation.,The program code does not contain comments and is difficult to read.
Algorithms and Control Structures,"(1) list the line number of each sprite interaction, and note the type of interaction. (2) list the line number of each place the program responds to user input, and note the type of user input (e.g. which key or mouse event).","The game includes multiple different interactions between sprites, responds to multiple types of user input (e.g. different arrow keys).",The game includes at least one type of sprite interaction and responds to user input.,"The game responds to user input through a conditional, but has no sprite interactions.",The game includes no conditionals.
Position and Movement,"list the line numbers of each place the program generates movement, and note whether the movement involves acceleration, keeping in mind that acceleration is incremental change to velocity (e.g. `sprite.velocityX = sprite.velocityX + 1` or `sprite.velocityY -= 1`).","Complex movement such as acceleration, moving in a curve, or jumping is included in multiple places in the program.","The program includes some complex movement, such as jumping, acceleration, or moving in a curve.","The program does not include complex movement such as jumping, acceleration or moving in a curve. However, the program does include simple independent movement, such as a straight line, rotation or bouncing.","There is no movement in the program, other than direct user control."
Variables,"(1) list the line number of every place a variable (including sprite properties) is updated inside the draw loop (2) for each variable or sprite property, describe whether it affects the user's experience of playing the game.",The game includes multiple variables or sprite properties that are updated during the game and affect the user's experience of playing the game.,The game includes at least one variable or sprite property that is updated during the game and affects the user's experience of playing the game.,There is at least one variable or sprite property updated in the program.,"There are no variables or sprite properties, or they are not updated."
