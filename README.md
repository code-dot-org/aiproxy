# AI Proxy

Python-based API layer for LLM API's, implemented as an HTTP API in ECS Fargate.

To Do:
* [x] validate cicd infra (using placeholder app template)
* [x] validate pr validation
* [ ] create python flask app
* [ ] add test steps for cicd
* [ ] add build & push-to-ecr steps for cicd
* [ ] create [application cloudformation template](cicd/3-app/aiproxy/template.yml)
* [ ] authentication

## Configuration

The configuration is done via environment variables stored in the `config.txt` file.

For local development, copy the `config.txt.sample` file to `config.txt` to have a
starting point. Then set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable to a valid OpenAI API key to
enable that service. Or, otherwise set that variable the appropriate way when
deploying the service.

To control the logging information, use the `LOG_LEVEL` configuration parameter. Set
to `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL`. The `DEBUG` setting is the
most permissive and shows all logging text. The `CRITICAL` prevents most logging
from happening. Most logging happens at `INFO`, which is the default setting.

## Local Development

All of our server code is written using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/).

The Flask web service exists within `/src`. The `__init__.py` is the
entry point for the app. The other files provide the routes.

Other related Python code that implement features are within `/lib`.

To build the app, use `docker compose build`.
You will need to rebuild when you change the source.

To run the app locally, use `docker compose up` from the repo root.

This will run a webserver accessible at <http://localhost:5000>.

**Note**: You need to provide the API keys in the `config.txt` file
before the service runs. See the above "Configuration" section.

## API

For information about the API, see the [API documentation](API.md).

## Testing

To run the test suite against the container, invoke the `./bin/test.sh` script. This will
build and run the container against the Python tests.

For information about testing the service, see the [Testing documentation](TESTING.md).
