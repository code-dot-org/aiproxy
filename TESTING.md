# Testing

This assumes you have built and are running the container as depicted in the main `README.md`.
In that case, you have a running server on port 5000.

## Scripted

You can run the provided Ruby script to issue a request to the server on your native machine.
To do so, if you have some system Ruby installed, you can invoke this command (at the root
of this repository):

```
ruby test/assessment-test.rb
```

This will ping the running server's `/assessment` route building out the appropriate `POST`
request with the test data in the `test` path of the repository.

## Curl

You can issue a "test" rubric assessment using hard-coded content that is found in the
`test/data` path by using the `/test/assessment` URL. Here, I'm using `curl` to show
me the headers and send a `POST` to that route (may take 30 to 50 seconds):

```
curl localhost:5000/test/assessment -i --header "Content-Type:multipart/form-data" --form "num-responses=3"
```

This gives me this response:

```

For each Key Concept you will answer by\ngiving the highest grade which accurately describes the student's program:\nExtensive Evidence, Convincing Evidence, Limited Evidence, or No\nEvidence. You will also provide a reason explaining your grade for each\nKey Concept, citing examples from the code to support your decision when possible.\n\nThe student's code should contain a method called `draw()` which will be\nreferred to as the \"draw loop\". Any code outside of the draw loop will be run\nonce, then any code inside the draw loop will be run repeatedly, like this:\n```\n// student's code\n\nwhile (true) {\n  draw();\n}\n```\n\nPlease keep in mind that acceleration occurs when the velocity of a sprite is changed incrementally within the draw loop, such as in these examples:\n* `sprite.velocityX += 0.2;`\n* `sprite.velocityY -= 1;`\n* `foo.velocityX = foo.velocityX + 5;`\n* `foo.velocityY = foo.velocityY - 10;`\n\nThe following examples do not count as acceleration, because they set the velocity to a specific value, rather than changing it incrementally:\n* `sprite.velocityX = 5;`\n* `sprite.velocityY = -10;`\n\nThe following does not count as acceleration, because it sets the velocity to a random value, rather than changing it incrementally:\n* `foo.velocityX = randomNumber(-5, 5);`\n\nThe student's code will access an API defined by Code.org's fork of the p5play\nlibrary. This API contains methods like createSprite(), background(), and drawSprites(),\nas well as sprite properties like x, y, velocityX and velocityY.\n\nIn order to help you evaluate the student's work, you will be given a rubric in\nCSV format. The first column provides the list of Key Concepts to evaluate,\nthe second column, Instructions, tells you what aspects of the code to consider\nwhen choosing a grade. the next four columns describe what it means for a program\nto be classified as each of the four possible grades.\n\nwhen choosing a grade for each Key Concept, please follow the following steps:\n1. follow the instructions in the Instructions column from the rubric to generate observations about the student's program. Include the result to the Observations column in your response.\n2. based on those observations, determine the highest grade which accurately describes the student's program. Write this result to the Grade column in your response.\n3. write a reason for your grade in the Reason column, citing evidence from the Observations column when possible.\n\nplease provide your evaluation formatted as a TSV table including a header row\nwith column names Key Concept, Observations, Grade, and Reason. There should be one\nnon-header row for each Key Concept.\n\nThe student's work should be evaluated based on what they have added beyond the\nstarter code that was provided to them.

If you want a cleaner response, ignore printing the headers and use Python as well:

```
curl localhost:5000/test/assessment --header "Content-Type:multipart/form-data" --form "num-responses=3" | python -m json.tool
```
